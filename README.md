## Usage instructions 

Usage instructions:

* Type '/mparty' to open the window.
* When a player opens a map, it will be automatically recorded with a checkmark.
* Maps can be manually added and removed by right-clicking on each party member's name or checkmarks.
* If someone links a waymark in party chat, it will be noted with a magnifying glass next to their name that you can hover over or click on to open your map with the waymark.
* The most recent party member to use a map will be highlighted in yellow.
* Maps auto-archive after 24 hours, and you can see recent party members' maps until then. You can also clear the slate manually if you're running multiple parties a day.
