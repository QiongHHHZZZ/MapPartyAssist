## Usage instructions 

* Enter '/mparty' into chat to open the window.
* When a player opens a map, it will be automatically recorded with a checkmark.
* Maps can be manually added and removed by right-clicking on each party member's name or checkmarks.
* If someone links a waymark in party chat, it will be noted with a magnifying glass next to their name that you can hover over or click on to open your map with the waymark.
* The most recent party member to use a map will be highlighted in yellow.
* Maps auto-archive after 24 hours, and you can see recent party members' maps until then. You can also clear the slate manually if you're running multiple parties a day.

### Important note:
* The plugin works by parsing system chat messages. I haven't verified that every map uses the same suite of messages, so let me know if it doesn't work for some. Also, it's not always possible to tell who exactly opened a map, so it might get confused if multiple people are using Dig at the same time. It might also fail if you're too far away from the party member who uses Dig. In these cases, you can manually add or remove. Thief's Maps, thankfully, are very reliable since they always generate a portal.
